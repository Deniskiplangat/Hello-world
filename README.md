# Hello-world
learning about the use of repositories
I have posted my first repository on june 27, 2020
We learn everyday, hopefully I will remember this day as important.
## Growth
This is an update on 5 september 2020, I relearnt how to push to github. Hopefully I can start storing all my projects here sooner.
I am really proud of you old Denis, I can only marvel at what we have learnt so far. After this update I hope that future Denis will have started learning Kotlin just as we have planned.
## Some more growth
Can now comfortable work with express and mongoose, connecting to servers is easier than ever authentication may prove to be a little headache, more practice is required. Reactjs is easier than expected...need to conquer redux next.
